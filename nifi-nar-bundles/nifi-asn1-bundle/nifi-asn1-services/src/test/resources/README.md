## Updating example.asn file

The unit tests and generated sources rely on the definition of `example.asn` file. When you update the file to fix/update/add unit tests, perform following operations to update derived resources.

1. Generate source files for unit test:

    ```
    $ jasn1/bin/jasn1-compiler -f example.asn -o ./../java
    ```

2. To generate 'test/resources/examples/*.dat' files, execute `ExampleDataGenerator`.

## Generating model JAR file

In order to test JASN1Reader running in a NiFi flow, a JAR file containing model classes that are generated by jASN1 compiler mentioned above. Such a JAR file can be created by the following command:

```
$ jar -cvf /tmp/jasn1-examples.jar -C nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-asn1-bundle/nifi-asn1-services/target/test-classes/ .
``` 

## NiFi flow template for test

The `ASN1.xml` is a NiFi flow template contains JASN1Reader and other processors to test the component.
